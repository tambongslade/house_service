# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature adds logout functionality to the provider profile screen, allowing users to securely sign out of their account. The logout feature will provide a clear and accessible way for users to end their session and return to the authentication flow.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a provider, I want to logout from my account from the profile screen, so that I can securely end my session and protect my account when I'm done using the app.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user is on the profile screen THEN the system SHALL display a logout option in the account actions section
2. WHEN the user taps the logout option THEN the system SHALL show a confirmation dialog to prevent accidental logout
3. WHEN the user confirms logout THEN the system SHALL call the logout API endpoint
4. WHEN the logout API call is successful THEN the system SHALL clear all stored authentication tokens
5. WHEN tokens are cleared THEN the system SHALL navigate the user back to the login/authentication screen
6. WHEN logout fails THEN the system SHALL display an appropriate error message to the user

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a provider, I want visual feedback during the logout process, so that I understand the system is processing my request.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user initiates logout THEN the system SHALL show a loading indicator during the API call
2. WHEN the logout is in progress THEN the system SHALL disable the logout button to prevent multiple requests
3. WHEN the logout completes successfully THEN the system SHALL show a brief success message before navigation
4. WHEN the logout fails THEN the system SHALL re-enable the logout button and show error details

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a provider, I want the logout functionality to be easily accessible and clearly labeled, so that I can quickly find it when needed.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user views the profile screen THEN the system SHALL display the logout option with a clear "Logout" label
2. WHEN the user views the logout option THEN the system SHALL use an appropriate icon (logout/exit icon)
3. WHEN the user views the logout option THEN the system SHALL position it prominently in the account actions section
4. WHEN the user views the logout option THEN the system SHALL use visual styling that indicates it's an important action (e.g., red color scheme)

# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature involves modifying the service creation flow to remove the availability setup step, since there is already a dedicated availability management page. The goal is to streamline the service creation process by focusing only on service details and ending the flow after service creation is complete.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a service provider, I want to create a service without being forced to set availability, so that I can complete service creation quickly and manage availability separately.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a provider completes the service creation form THEN the system SHALL create the service and end the flow
2. WHEN the service creation is successful THEN the system SHALL show a success message and navigate back to the services list
3. WHEN the service creation flow is complete THEN the system SHALL NOT require availability setup

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a service provider, I want the service creation flow to be simplified, so that I can focus on service details without additional steps.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a provider accesses the service creation screen THEN the system SHALL show only one step for service details
2. WHEN the provider clicks the action button THEN the system SHALL complete the service creation instead of proceeding to availability setup
3. WHEN the service is created THEN the system SHALL set a default availability status without requiring user input

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a service provider, I want my newly created service to have a reasonable default state, so that it can be functional without immediate availability configuration.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a service is created without availability setup THEN the system SHALL set the service as available by default
2. WHEN a service is created THEN the system SHALL NOT create any specific time slot availability records
3. WHEN a service is created THEN the provider SHALL be able to configure availability later through the dedicated availability page

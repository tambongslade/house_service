# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature addresses linter errors in the Flutter application's core API service and UI screens. The goal is to fix all linting violations to improve code quality, maintainability, and adherence to Dart/Flutter best practices.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want all linter errors fixed in the codebase, so that the code follows Dart/Flutter best practices and is maintainable.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN analyzing the API service file THEN there SHALL be no linter warnings or errors
2. WHEN analyzing the provider bookings screen THEN there SHALL be no linter warnings or errors  
3. WHEN analyzing the provider profile screen THEN there SHALL be no linter warnings or errors
4. WHEN running `flutter analyze` THEN the exit code SHALL be 0 with no issues reported

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want deprecated API usage replaced with current alternatives, so that the code remains compatible with future Flutter versions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN using Color opacity methods THEN the code SHALL use `withOpacity()` instead of deprecated `withValues(alpha:)`
2. WHEN using animation or UI methods THEN all deprecated APIs SHALL be replaced with current alternatives
3. WHEN building the project THEN there SHALL be no deprecation warnings

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want unused variables and imports removed, so that the codebase is clean and efficient.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN analyzing files THEN there SHALL be no unused import statements
2. WHEN analyzing files THEN there SHALL be no unused variables or parameters
3. WHEN analyzing files THEN there SHALL be no unreachable code

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want consistent code formatting and style, so that the codebase is readable and follows team standards.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN reviewing variable references THEN undefined variables SHALL be fixed or properly imported
2. WHEN reviewing method calls THEN all method calls SHALL reference existing methods
3. WHEN reviewing code structure THEN all syntax errors SHALL be resolved
